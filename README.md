# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

I present to you, a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This application also functions offline.

## User Story

**AS A** developer... **I WANT** to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection... **SO THAT** I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria

- **GIVEN a text editor web application**

```
WHEN I open my application in my editor
┗►THEN I should see a client server folder structure

WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
┗►THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
┗►THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

WHEN I run my webpack plugins
┗►THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
┗►THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

WHEN I open the text editor
┗►THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
┗►THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
┗►THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

WHEN I click on the Install button
┗►THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

WHEN I load my web application
┗►THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox

WHEN I register a service worker
